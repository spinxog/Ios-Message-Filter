# Ios-Message-Filter
Ios message filter using Naive bayes classifier

Naive bayes is based on Bayes Theorem which is helps us invent conditional probilities, allowing us to file the probablity of a cause given its effect. Its formula is generally very easy to understand, given little previous knowledge of statistics. 

Although the formula is relativlty simple, coding the formula is a little more diffcult. However, thanks to sklearns library we are able to just import it.

This only currently works on Mac, since I am only checking the the icloud file with all the messages.
